			<h1>Computer Network</h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<h3>A computer network is an interconnected group of computers. </h3>

			<p> In general, the term network can refer to any interconnected group or system.
			More specifically, a network is any method of sharing information between two systems
			(human or mechanical).</p>
			<h4>BENEFITS OF SHARING INFORMATION VIA NETWORK</h4>
			<p>In addition to reducing hardware costs by sharing expensive printers and other
			peripherals among multiple users, networks provide additional benefits to the users.</p>
			<ul><li> Software and data files can be shared for access by multiple users</li>
			<li>Electronic mail e-mail can be sent and received</li>
			<li>
				Collaboration features allow contributions by multiple users to a single document
			</li>
			<li>
				Remote-control programs can be used to troubleshoot problems or show new users
				how to perform a task</li></ul>




			<h3>SHARED HARDWARE COMPONENTS</h3>
			<p>Virtually, any storage or output device can be shared over a network, but the most
			common devices to be used over a network include:</p>
			<ul><li>Printers
			<li>
				Disk drives</li>
			<li>
				CD-ROM and optical drives</li>
			<li>
				Modems</li>
			<li>
				Fax</li>
			<li> Tape backup units</li></ul>
			
	<h3>Network topology</h3> 	
		<p>Network Topology signifies the way in which intelligent devices in the network see their logical relations to one another. The use of the term "logical" here is significant. That is, network topology is independent of the "physical" layout of the network. Even if networked computers are physically placed in a linear arrangement, if they are connected via a hub, the network has a Star topology, rather than a Bus Topology. In this regard the visual and operational characteristics of a network are distinct; the logical network topology is not necessarily the same as the physical layout. </p>
<h3>Local Area Network</h3> 	
<p>A network covering a small geographic area, like a home, office, or building. Current LANs are most likely to be based on Ethernet technology. For example, a library will have a wired or wireless LAN for users to interconnect local devices (e.g., printers and servers) and to connect to the internet. </p>

	<h3>Client/Server Vs Peer-to-Peer Networks </h3>
	<p>Although every computer on a LAN is connected to every other, they do not necessarily mean all communicate with each other. There are two basic types of LAN, based on communication patterns between the machines, called client/server networks and peer-to-peer networks. </p>

			<h1>Client/Server Networks </h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<p>Every computer has a distinct role, that of either a client or a server. A server is designed to share its resources among client computers on the network. The Client/Server is composed of:  </p>
			<h3>Servers </h3>
			<p>These are located in secured areas, such as locked closets and data centers, because they hold the organization's most valuable data and do not have the accessed by operators on a continuous basis. The server runs a special network operating system such as: Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 or Novell Netware. </p>
			<h3>Clients</h3>
			<p>The rest of the computers on the network functions as client. A client standard PC that is running an operating system such as DOS or Windows.</p>
			
	<h3>
		Internetwork 
	</h3>
		<p>Two or more networks or network segments connected using devices that operate at layer 3 (the 'network' layer) of the OSI Basic Reference Model, such as a router. Any interconnection among or between public, private, commercial, industrial, or governmental networks may also be defined as an internetwork. 
 In modern practice, the interconnected networks use the Internet Protocol. There are at least three variants of internetwork, depending on who administers and who participates in them: Intranet, Extranet, Internet .<br>
 Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet is normally protected from being accessed from the Internet without proper authorization. The Internet is not considered to be a part of the intranet or extranet, although it may serve as a portal for access to portions of an extranet. 
 
 </p>
<h3>Intranet</h3>
			<p>An intranet is a set of interconnected networks, using the Internet Protocol and uses IP-based tools such as web browsers and ftp tools, that is under the control of a single administrative entity. That administrative entity closes the intranet to the rest of the world, and allows only specific users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal network of a company or other enterprise.</p>
<h3>Extranet</h3>
			<p>An extranet is a network or internetwork that is limited in scope to a single organization or entity but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other usually, but not necessarily, trusted organizations or entities (e.g. a company's customers may be given access to some part of its intranet creating in this way an extranet, while at the same time the customers may not be considered 'trusted' from a security standpoint). Technically, an extranet may also be categorized as a CAN, MAN, WAN, or other type of network, although, by definition, an extranet cannot consist of a single LAN; it must have at least one connection with an external network.</p>
<h3>Internet</h3>
			<p>A specific internetwork, consisting of a worldwide interconnection of governmental, academic, public, and private networks based upon the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) developed by ARPA of the U.S. Department of Defense – also home to the World Wide Web (WWW) and referred to as the 'Internet' with a capital 'I' to distinguish it from other generic internetworks. </p>

			<h1>Common Problems </h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<p>Today's computers have faster microprocessors, more memory and bigger hard drives. When you think about the differences between a Pentium 4 and 386, you have to conclude the improvement is astounding! But when error attacks your computer you have to do something for the computers to survive. Here are some of the common faults and problems that you may encounter:
			</p>
			<h3>Why computer becomes slow?  </h3>
			<h4>You need more memory</h4><p>
	Don't overlook the obvious. Up until recently not having enough memory wasn't a problem. With the price of RAM becoming very affordable, most people were filling their computers with more than enough memory to do the job. If your computer is slow and it has lower capacity of RAM, you need to add more memory to speed it up.
</p>
			<h4>Spyware and viruses</h4>
			<p>Spyware. It is a software program that is intentionally installed on the computer by the user to monitor or spy on what the other users of the same computer is doing.
For this program to be effective, you have to keep up to date. By up to date, it means up to the minute.<br> <br>
      Virus. A software program, macro or script that has been designed to infect, destroy, modify or cause other problems with computer or software program.</p>

			<h4>
				Background programs
			</h4>
			<p>
				
				When you install new software on your computer, often times you install it to run in the background every time you start up. Most times you do this without knowing it. Look at the bottom right hand side of your screen.
				If you see several icons there, you have extra programs running and stealing resources. Right click on these and see if you have the option of closing them. Many times, you can open the program and choose an option to keep these programs from starting automatically. 

			</p>
			<h4>Corrupted registry</h4>
			<p>
Any changes you make to your computer effects and actually, it corrupts your registry even when you do something positive like remove spyware and you end up with a corrupted registry.
After months of corrupting your registry, it will become good. This will, in its early stages, cause your computer to slow down. In its advanced stages, it will freeze and crash and do more mysterious and troublesome things.</p>

			<h1>Basic Toubleshooting</h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			
			<h3>After I pressing the Power button... </h3>
			<h4>Nothing happened</h4><p>•	Check mains plug switched on at wall <br> •	PSU may have its own power switch - check this is on<br>
•	Check PSU-to-Motherboard cable(s) are correctly connected  <br>•	Check front panel power switch is correctly connected  <br>• Check Reset button is not stuck 'in' <br> • Check mains cable fuse 
			</p>
			<h4>There was a loud bang (possibly with smoke) at the back of the PC Case </h4>
			<p>
				PSU was faulty or set to incorrect voltage for mains supply system. Replace PSU 
			</p>

			<h4>
				PC is on but monitor shows no display and a sequence of beeps emits from the PC 
			</h4>
			<p>

				• Check fitting of CPU, RAM, Video card, sound card etc. If necessary, remove and refit these components <br> 
				• Check the motherboard manual and perform a BIOS reset procedure  <br>
				• This may indicate a faulty motherboard    <br>

			</p>
			<h4>PC is on but monitor shows no display and one beep emits from the PC </h4>
			<p>
				• Check monitor is switched on at the wall socket  <br>
				• Check monitor power cable is connected correctly  <br>
				• Check that the monitor's signal cable is connected correctly to both the PC and Monitor  <br>
				• Check that the monitor is switched on at its front panel  <br>
				• This may indicate a faulty video card<br>
			</p>


			<h4>PC is on but there are no power and/or HDD lights on the PC case front panel</h4>
			<p>
				• Check correct connection of front panel connectors to the motherboard (see motherboard manual) <br> 
				• This 'may' indicate a faulty Motherboard <br>
			</p>

			<h4>PPC is on but HDD does not spin up </h4>
			<p>
				• Check power connector to HDD is properly connected  <br> 
				• Check IDE ribbon cable is correctly connected to both Motherboard and HDD  <br> 
				• This may indicate a faulty Hard Drive<br> 

			</p>

			<h4>PC is on but CD-ROM shows no lights/will not eject tray </h4>
			<p>
				• Check power connector to CD-ROM is properly connected<br> 
				• Check IDE ribbon cable is correctly connected to both Motherboard and CD-ROM  <br> 
				• This may indicate a faulty CD-ROM Drive<br> 
			</p>

			<h4>PC is on but the CPU fan/fans do not spin </h4>
			<p>
				• Disconnect the power immediately to prevent damage to the CPU from overheating  <br> 
				• Check fan power cables are correctly connected to the relevant power connector (in most cases, a motherboard FAN connector or one of the PSU power connectors)  <br> 
				• Disconnect the power and carefully spin the fan blades with a finger. If there is any resistance to this movement, this may indicate a faulty fan unit <br> 
			</p>


			<h4>On boot up, the monitor shows corrupted display  </h4>
			<p>
				• Check seating of CPU, RAM, Video card, sound card etc. If necessary, remove and refit these components  <br>
				• Check the motherboard manual and perform a BIOS reset procedure  <br>
				• This may indicate a faulty Motherboard or Video card   <br>
			</p>

			<h4>On boot up, display shows incorrect CPU type/speed </h4>
			<p>
				• Check the motherboard manual for the appropriate CPU jumper settings (where applicable)  <br>
				• Check BIOS settings for CPU type (see Motherboard Manual)  <br>
				• Perform a BIOS reset procedure  <br>
				• Perform a BIOS update (with an updated BIOS, the Motherboard may support your CPU)  <br>
				• This may indicate a faulty/old motherboard <br>
			</p>

			<h4>On boot up, display shows incorrect RAM total </h4>
			<p>
				• Check correct seating of Memory Modules in slots  <br>
				• In cases of two or more modules, this may indicate a faulty module  <br>
				• This may indicate a faulty/old motherboard <br>
			</p>

			<h4>On boot up, display shows - FDD/Keyboard/Mouse not found (or similar) </h4>
			<p>
				• Check correct connection of device described, In the case of the FDD, check its ribbon and power connections  <br>
				• Check that the BIOS is configured correctly for the device described  <br>
				• This may indicate a fault with the described device or Motherboard<br>
			

			</p>
			<h4>The monitor shows no picture </h4>
			<p>
				• Is the power light on?  <br>
				• Are the cables plugged in?  <br>
				• Check brightness and contrast settings.  <br>
				• Swap the monitor with another one, reboot the machine and see if it works. If the computer works the monitor has probably gone bad.  If it still fails to work, something in the CPU perhaps a video card has gone bad.<br>
			</p>

			<h4>Computer displays limited colors</h4>
			<p>
				• Check display options for the monitor usually under control panel under the display icon.  Select at least 256 colors for standard display. If you had 16 color selected, this may be why your screen displays limited colors.  Some programs such as FastCat require you to set display settings to 256 colors.  <br>
