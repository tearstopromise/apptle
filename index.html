		<h3>Here are some safety precautions to take before working with any computer devices:</h3>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Do not work on computer when you are wet because you might get electrocuted.</li>
		<li>Do not remove internal devices of the computer when it is turned on.</li>
		<li>Be sure not to mix electronic components and water.</li>
		<li>Avoid playing or running while inside the room.</li>
		<li>
			Always wear personal protective equipments (PPE) like coverall, shoes with rubber

		</li>
		<li>
			Ask for assistance from your teacher when it comes on dealing with computer
			devices.
		</li>
		<li>
			Applying safety measure when handling tools and equipment are necessary to

			<h3>A computer network is an interconnected group of computers. </h3>

			<p> In general, the term network can refer to any interconnected group or system.
			More specifically, a network is any method of sharing information between two systems
			(human or mechanical).</p>
			<h4>BENEFITS OF SHARING INFORMATION VIA NETWORK</h4>
			<p>In addition to reducing hardware costs by sharing expensive printers and other
			peripherals among multiple users, networks provide additional benefits to the users.</p>
			<ul><li> Software and data files can be shared for access by multiple users</li>
			<li>Electronic mail e-mail can be sent and received</li>
			<li>
				Collaboration features allow contributions by multiple users to a single document
			</li>
			<li>
				Remote-control programs can be used to troubleshoot problems or show new users
				how to perform a task</li></ul>




			<h3>SHARED HARDWARE COMPONENTS</h3>
			<p>Virtually, any storage or output device can be shared over a network, but the most
			common devices to be used over a network include:</p>
			<ul><li>Printers
			<li>
				Disk drives</li>
			<li>
				CD-ROM and optical drives</li>
			<li>
				Modems</li>
			<li>
				Fax</li>
			<li> Tape backup units</li></ul>
			
	<h3>Network topology</h3> 	
		<p>Network Topology signifies the way in which intelligent devices in the network see their logical relations to one another. The use of the term "logical" here is significant. That is, network topology is independent of the "physical" layout of the network. Even if networked computers are physically placed in a linear arrangement, if they are connected via a hub, the network has a Star topology, rather than a Bus Topology. In this regard the visual and operational characteristics of a network are distinct; the logical network topology is not necessarily the same as the physical layout. </p>
<h3>Local Area Network</h3> 	
<p>A network covering a small geographic area, like a home, office, or building. Current LANs are most likely to be based on Ethernet technology. For example, a library will have a wired or wireless LAN for users to interconnect local devices (e.g., printers and servers) and to connect to the internet. </p>

	<h3>Client/Server Vs Peer-to-Peer Networks </h3>
	<p>Although every computer on a LAN is connected to every other, they do not necessarily mean all communicate with each other. There are two basic types of LAN, based on communication patterns between the machines, called client/server networks and peer-to-peer networks. </p>

			<h1>Client/Server Networks </h1>
		</div>
		<div data-role="content">
			<p>Every computer has a distinct role, that of either a client or a server. A server is designed to share its resources among client computers on the network. The Client/Server is composed of:  </p>
			<h3>Servers </h3>
			<p>These are located in secured areas, such as locked closets and data centers, because they hold the organization's most valuable data and do not have the accessed by operators on a continuous basis. The server runs a special network operating system such as: Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 or Novell Netware. </p>
			<h3>Clients</h3>
			<p>The rest of the computers on the network functions as client. A client standard PC that is running an operating system such as DOS or Windows.</p>
			
	<h3>
		Internetwork 
	</h3>
		<p>Two or more networks or network segments connected using devices that operate at layer 3 (the 'network' layer) of the OSI Basic Reference Model, such as a router. Any interconnection among or between public, private, commercial, industrial, or governmental networks may also be defined as an internetwork. 
 In modern practice, the interconnected networks use the Internet Protocol. There are at least three variants of internetwork, depending on who administers and who participates in them: Intranet, Extranet, Internet .<br>
 Intranets and extranets may or may not have connections to the Internet. If connected to the Internet, the intranet or extranet is normally protected from being accessed from the Internet without proper authorization. The Internet is not considered to be a part of the intranet or extranet, although it may serve as a portal for access to portions of an extranet. 
 
 </p>
<h3>Intranet</h3>
			<p>An intranet is a set of interconnected networks, using the Internet Protocol and uses IP-based tools such as web browsers and ftp tools, that is under the control of a single administrative entity. That administrative entity closes the intranet to the rest of the world, and allows only specific users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal network of a company or other enterprise.</p>
<h3>Extranet</h3>
			<p>An extranet is a network or internetwork that is limited in scope to a single organization or entity but which also has limited connections to the networks of one or more other usually, but not necessarily, trusted organizations or entities (e.g. a company's customers may be given access to some part of its intranet creating in this way an extranet, while at the same time the customers may not be considered 'trusted' from a security standpoint). Technically, an extranet may also be categorized as a CAN, MAN, WAN, or other type of network, although, by definition, an extranet cannot consist of a single LAN; it must have at least one connection with an external network.</p>
<h3>Internet</h3>
			<p>A specific internetwork, consisting of a worldwide interconnection of governmental, academic, public, and private networks based upon the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) developed by ARPA of the U.S. Department of Defense – also home to the World Wide Web (WWW) and referred to as the 'Internet' with a capital 'I' to distinguish it from other generic internetworks. </p>
