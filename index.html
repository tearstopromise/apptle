			<h3>A computer network is an interconnected group of computers. </h3>

			<p> In general, the term network can refer to any interconnected group or system.
			More specifically, a network is any method of sharing information between two systems
			(human or mechanical).</p>
			<h4>BENEFITS OF SHARING INFORMATION VIA NETWORK</h4>
			<p>In addition to reducing hardware costs by sharing expensive printers and other
			peripherals among multiple users, networks provide additional benefits to the users.</p>
			<ul><li> Software and data files can be shared for access by multiple users</li>
			<li>Electronic mail e-mail can be sent and received</li>
			<li>
				Collaboration features allow contributions by multiple users to a single document
			</li>
			<li>
				Remote-control programs can be used to troubleshoot problems or show new users
				how to perform a task</li></ul>

			<h3>SHARED HARDWARE COMPONENTS</h3>
			<p>Virtually, any storage or output device can be shared over a network, but the most
			common devices to be used over a network include:</p>
			<ul><li>Printers
			<li>
				Disk drives</li>
			<li>
				CD-ROM and optical drives</li>
